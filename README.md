# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on diagnostic features. The primary goal is to assist in early detection of breast cancer using structured data from the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

## Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves survival rates. This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies tumors as benign or malignant using diagnostic features, providing a data-driven decision support tool for healthcare professionals.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Instances**: 569
- **Features**: 30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness, etc.)
- **Target**: Diagnosis (`M = Malignant`, `B = Benign`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `ucimlrepo`
- `joblib`

---

##  Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier** (tuned using GridSearchCV)

---

## Results Summary

- **Accuracy**: 96.49%
- **F1-Score**: 0.97 (benign), 0.95 (malignant)
- **Best Model**: Random Forest
- **Top Features**: Worst perimeter, mean concave points, worst radius

---

## üìà Visualizations

- Class distribution plot
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Feature importance bar chart

---

##  Future Scope

- Deploy model as a web app for real-time use
- Integrate with electronic health records (EHRs)
- Use explainability tools (SHAP, LIME)
- Explore deep learning for image-based diagnosis
- Validate across more diverse populations
